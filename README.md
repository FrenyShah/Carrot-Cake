Hey!!!
i love carrot cakes! It's my all-time favourite. 

Why do i like carrot cake?
Here's why!
The fiber in carrots can help keep blood sugar levels under control. And they're loaded with vitamin A and beta-carotene, which there's evidence to suggest can lower your diabetes risk. They can strengthen your bones. Carrots have calcium and vitamin K, both of which are important for bone health.
ANDDD becuase it's way to yummy!

i hope you enjoy it!
